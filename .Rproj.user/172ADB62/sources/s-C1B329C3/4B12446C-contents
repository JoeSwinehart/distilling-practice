```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")

```
I wonder if I can upload and add cat pictures to my web page?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "This plot is super hot")
#+
 # theme(text = element_text(family = "Roboto"))
```
